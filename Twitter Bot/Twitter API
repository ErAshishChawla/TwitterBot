In this project we will learn how to create a twitter bot. This twitter bot will do bunch of interesting things
like
1. Following back people
2. Retweeting something
3. Liking tweets based on some keyword

This section requires us to work with twitter API. Some websites give us data using api, and some don't for them we use
scraping to get data. However there are also permissive APIs, twitter gives us the data but we require permission

Twitter API Keys

API KEY
API SECRET KEY
BEARER TOKEN
ACCESS TOKEN
ACCESS TOKEN SECRET

These keys can be regenerated. Please check config file for latest keys

After requesting access to twitter api and creating an app and getting the keys, we will use tweepy python library
to interact with twitter api
